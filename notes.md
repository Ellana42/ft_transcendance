- set current channel at channel creation

- deal with dms duplicate
- invites
	- invite display 
	- accept invite makes you join channel
	- can't see private channels
- fix service announcement for unban
- muted at start issue
- passwords 1) chat has password 2) field popup to enter said password
- change msg.read if current channel

- when it's opened reload settings every minute ?
